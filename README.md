# RuPaul's Drag Race Pronostic

I have written this nodejs webapp quickly to automate the forecast of RuPaul's Drag Race All Star 6 results.
Views were written with EJS, with custom CSS + Bootstrap.
Results are updated directly in the DB (Mongoose).
Deployment is done with Heroku, with a slight DNS configuration to use a custom domain.
